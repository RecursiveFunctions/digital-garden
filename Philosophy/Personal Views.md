On this I'll post a handful of philosophers and influential figures I've learned about (mostly from my time as an undergrad at SDSU). Nothin' fancy, most of it's just gonna be a handful of notes, although I'll probably expand on them. No I'm not a Philosophy major. but I think Philosophy is important, if not for its own sake, then as a way to improve our (critical) thinking in other fields like Computer Science. 

# My personal views
* I value the ability to humor different points of view to understand them without necessarily agreeing with all (or any) of their points.
* Philosophy should go hand in hand with science. I think it's important to critically evaluate things from different perspectives. 
	* consequently, diversity of thought is promoted through diversity of lived experiences. 
	* science is not the end-all be-all of things. It's a methodology for continuously evaluating data, turning it into facts and from there, creating knowledge.
* Everything is inherently political. ergo Science is inherently political.
