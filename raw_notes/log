For example, I [[AI/Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI|Changed the sort order of my daily notes]] from most recent on top to oldest on bottom. That entire page was also created by Cursor AI. I got the idea from Geoffrey Huntley's article on [asking Cursor to write rules](https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/). If I can ask cursor to update cursor rules with what it's learned, then asking it to put its learnings in a .md file should be no problem. \n" +

    `One could argue that I could also learn much faster in this manner. But these lessons learned weren't from my own struggles and frustrations, they came from AI, so how hard are they going to stick to my brain? Perhaps the next best thing is to critically analyze the lessons learned from the AI model and ask more questions. For example, in [[Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI|AI/Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI| The Solution]] I could ask "how does removing the leading slash improve the check for daily notes?" because that's exactly the kind of question I'd expect anyone reading this to ask, among other things. \n` +

    "1. Signal is an encrypted messaging app, but it's still a consumer application not designed for sharing [[202503261649|sensitive military information]].\n" +
    '2. NSA Director Timothy Haugh confirmed Signal has vulnerabilities and testified that the shared information "would be classified" had it been intercepted from Russia or China.\n' +

    'This incident perfectly illustrates the tension between convenience and security in our digital age. Yes, Signal offers end-to-end encryption, but proper operational security involves much more than just encrypted messages.

    '## Graph Center Positioning Fix\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Today I fixed an issue where nodes were incorrectly appearing from the top-left corner of the screen instead of from the center as intended:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. **Root Cause Analysis**:\n' +
    '   - Identified that the initial node positioning was being overridden during the rendering process\n' +
    "   - Discovered that D3's default behavior was causing nodes to shift before the staggered animation began\n" +
    '   - Found that the simulation was running automatically before we could set positions correctly\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. **Complete Position Control Implementation**:\n' +
    '   - Explicitly stopped the force simulation at initialization to prevent automatic movement\n' +
    '   - Set alpha to 0 initially to keep nodes stationary until intentionally moved\n' +
    '   - Force-positioned all visual elements (nodes, labels, links) at exact center coordinates\n' +
    '   - Added immediate position updates within the staggered animation sequence\n' +
    '\n' +
    '3. **Visual Enhancements**:\n' +
    '   - Made labels initially invisible, fading them in as their nodes appear\n' +
    '   - Created a more controlled expansion from center effect\n' +
    '   - Implemented direct position control during the animation sequence\n' +
    '   - Ensured links follow nodes properly during the animation\n' +
    '\n' +
    '4. **Animation Improvements**:\n' +
    '   - Created rapid-fire node population within each depth level (20ms intervals)\n' +
    '   - Implemented 800ms pauses between depth groups for visual clarity\n' +
    '   - Increased random offsets for more dramatic, energetic movement\n' +
    '   - Applied higher alpha values to make nodes "pop" into place\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This fix ensures nodes now properly spawn from the center of the graph in a visually appealing, intentional pattern, rather than appearing from the top-left corner of the screen. '

    "I wanted to change up the functionality of the graph so that I could hide nodes or change their titles. Since I'm trying to switch over to a more zettelkasten style of note taking, I don't want the nodes in my graph to have names like these\n" +

    '\n' +
    'So instead I defined custom properties to use a user-provided title for the node when the graph is generated.\n' +
    '## Custom Graph Titles\n' +
    '\n' +
    'You can use the `dg-graph-title` property to customize how nodes appear in the graph:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```yaml\n' +
    '---\n' +
    'dg-graph-title: "Custom Graph Label"\n' +
    '---\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Without this property, nodes will display using:\n' +

    '2. Filename as fallback\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Excluding Notes from Graph\n' +
    '\n' +
    'To completely hide a note from the graph, add:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```yaml\n' +
    '---\n' +
    'dg-graph-exclude: true\n' +
    '---\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'When this property is set to `true`:\n' +
    "- The note won't appear in the graph\n" +
    "- Links to this note won't be displayed\n" +

    'This is useful for notes that:\n' +

    '## Technical Implementation\n' +
    '\n' +
    'These features were implemented by modifying the `getGraph()` function in `src/helpers/linkUtils.js`. The changes:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. Added support for `dg-graph-title` to customize node labels\n' +
    '2. Created an `excludedNodes` set to track excluded notes\n' +
    '3. Modified node creation to respect `dg-graph-exclude: true`\n' +
    '4. Added filtering of links to exclude connections to hidden nodes\n' +
    '5. Made sure string values (`"true"`) are handled the same as boolean values\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The updated code uses:\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '// Use custom graph title or fall back to defaults\n' +
    'title: v.data["dg-graph-title"] || v.data.title || v.fileSlug,\n' +
    '\n' +
    '// Check for excluded notes (handles both boolean and string values)\n' +
    'if (v.data["dg-graph-exclude"] === true || v.data["dg-graph-exclude"] === "true") {\n' +
    '  excludedNodes.add(v.url);\n' +

    '\n' +
    '## Issues Fixed\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. Wiki-links using permalinks (like `[[/daily-notes/|Daily Notes]]`) were causing build errors\n' +
    '2. The system was incorrectly prepending the base path (`src/site/notes/`) multiple times\n' +
    '3. Automatic creation of stub files for missing links was causing bloat and confusion\n' +
    '4. File read operations on directories were causing EISDIR errors\n' +
    '5. A permalink format issue in one file was causing file/directory conflicts\n' +
    '6. Wiki-links to root files were incorrectly resolving to `/notes/filename` instead of using the permalink\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Detailed Changes\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Adding Special Handling for Permalink Wiki-Links\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** Links in the format `[[/daily-notes/|Title]]` were being treated as file paths with slashes instead of as permalinks.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'function getAnchorAttributes(filePath, linkTitle) {\n' +
    '  let fileName = filePath.replaceAll("&amp;", "&");\n' +
    '  let header = "";\n' +
    '  let headerLinkPath = "";\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  if (filePath.includes("#")) {\n' +
    '    [fileName, header] = filePath.split("#");\n' +
    '    headerLinkPath = `#${headerToId(header)}`;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  let noteIcon = process.env.NOTE_ICON_DEFAULT;\n' +
    '  const title = linkTitle ? linkTitle : fileName;\n' +
    '  let permalink = `/notes/${slugify(fileName)}`;\n' +
    '  let deadLink = false;\n' +
    '  // ... rest of function\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'function getAnchorAttributes(filePath, linkTitle) {\n' +
    '  let fileName = filePath.replaceAll("&amp;", "&");\n' +
    '  let header = "";\n' +
    '  let headerLinkPath = "";\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  // Handle permalinks in wiki-links\n' +
    "  if (filePath.startsWith('/') && filePath.endsWith('/')) {\n" +
    '    // This is a permalink-style link, extract without the slashes\n' +
    '    const permalinkPath = filePath.slice(1, -1);\n' +
    '    let noteIcon = process.env.NOTE_ICON_DEFAULT;\n' +
    '    const title = linkTitle ? linkTitle : permalinkPath;\n' +
    '    \n' +
    '    // Simply use the permalink directly\n' +
    '    return {\n' +
    '      attributes: {\n' +
    '        "class": "internal-link",\n' +
    '        "target": "",\n' +
    '        "data-note-icon": noteIcon,\n' +
    '        "href": `${filePath}`,\n' +
    '      },\n' +
    '      innerHTML: title,\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  if (filePath.includes("#")) {\n' +
    '    [fileName, header] = filePath.split("#");\n' +
    '    headerLinkPath = `#${headerToId(header)}`;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '  // ... rest of function\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Explanation:** This change adds special handling for wiki-links that use the permalink format (`[[/permalink/|Title]]`). When detected, it immediately returns the correct attributes without attempting to resolve the file path, preventing errors when trying to read directories.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. Preventing Duplicate Path Prefixes\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** The system was incorrectly adding `src/site/notes/` to paths that already included this prefix.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '  // If the path already contains a directory structure, treat it differently\n' +
    "  if (fileName.includes('/')) {\n" +
    "    // Try to get or create the file if it doesn't exist\n" +
    '    try {\n' +
    '      fullPath = getOrCreateNoteStub(fileName);\n' +
    '    } catch (e) {\n' +
    '      fullPath = fileName.endsWith(".md") \n' +
    '        ? `${startPath}${fileName}` \n' +
    '        : `${startPath}${fileName}.md`;\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    "  // Make sure we don't duplicate the base path\n" +
    "  if (fileName.startsWith('src/site/notes/')) {\n" +
    "    fileName = fileName.replace('src/site/notes/', '');\n" +
    '  }\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  // If the path already contains a directory structure, treat it differently\n' +
    "  if (fileName.includes('/')) {\n" +
    "    // Don't attempt to create stub files, just construct the path\n" +
    '    fullPath = fileName.endsWith(".md") \n' +
    '      ? `${startPath}${fileName}` \n' +
    '      : `${startPath}${fileName}.md`;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Explanation:** This change checks if the file path already includes the base path and removes it if found. This prevents file paths like `src/site/notes/src/site/notes/file.md` which were causing errors.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Removing Automatic Stub File Creation\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** The system was automatically creating stub files for links that pointed to non-existent files.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '// Helper function to handle missing files by creating stubs\n' +

    '    ? `${startPath}${filePath}` \n' +
    '    : `${startPath}${filePath}.md`;\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  try {\n' +
    '    // Check if file exists first\n' +
    '    fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");\n' +

    '  } catch (e) {\n' +
    "    // File doesn't exist, try to create a stub\n" +
    '    try {\n' +
    '      const fileName = filePath.split("/").pop();\n' +

    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** The file `202503261845.md` had a permalink without the standard leading and trailing slashes, causing path conflicts.\n' +

    '\n' +
    'First, the issue was thought to be in the `getAnchorAttributes` function, and we added a check for direct file matches in the root directory:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '// Check for exact file match in the root directory first\n' +

    "However, this change alone didn't resolve the issue.\n" +

    '# Fixing Transclusion Link Handling in Eleventy.js\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This note documents the process of debugging and fixing an issue with transclusion link handling in the Digital Garden Eleventy setup.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Problem Statement\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Transclusion links using the `![[filename]]` syntax were not being processed correctly. Instead of transcluding the content of the referenced file, they were being rendered as regular internal links.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Debugging Steps\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. The `link` filter in `.eleventy.js` was modified to prioritize handling transclusion links before other link types. However, this change alone did not resolve the issue, indicating something else was interfering.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. A `grep` search was performed across the codebase to find other code that might be processing the `![[filename]]` syntax. This revealed that the `obsidian-image-embeds` transform was also capturing these links.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## The scenic path to identifying the *real* problem\n' +
    '\n' +
    'initially, I thought that the `obsidian-image-embeds` transform, intended to handle Obsidian-style image links like `![[image.png]]`, had a regular expression that was too broad:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```js\n' +
    '/!\\[\\[(.*?\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|webp))\\]\\]/gi\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The `(.*?\\.` part of this regex was matching any characters up until a dot, even if those characters included square brackets `[]`. This caused it to accidentally match non-image transclusion links like `![[note.md]]`.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Since this transform ran after the `link` filter, it was overriding the transclusion link handling.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Proposed Solution\n' +
    '\n' +
    'To fix this, the regex in `obsidian-image-embeds` was modified to be more specific:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```js\n' +
    '/!\\[\\[([^[\\]]*\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|webp))\\]\\]/gi\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The key change is `([^[\\]]*\\.` which ensures it only matches filenames without `[]` characters. This prevents it from capturing `![[note.md]]` type links.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "After deploying the changes, it turned out this wasn't the issue, because `![[file]]` syntax was being rendered as an internal link, and ignoring the ! symbol. Maybe it's the filters and transforms?\n" +
    '\n' +
    '# adding a explicit transclusion filter\n' +
    ' a new `transclusion` filter was created to handle the `![[filename]]` syntax before the `link` filter:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```js\n' +
    'eleventyConfig.addFilter("transclusion", function (str) {\n' +
    '  return (\n' +
    '    str &&\n' +
    '    str.replace(/!\\[\\[(.*?)\\]\\]/g, (match, filename) => {\n' +
    '      const filePath = findFile(filename);\n' +
    '      if (filePath) {\n' +
    "        const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');\n" +
    '        \n' +
    '        // Parse the frontmatter and content\n' +
    '        const parsed = matter(fileContent);\n' +
    '        \n' +
    '        // Render only the content part (excluding frontmatter)\n' +
    '        return `<div class="transclusion">${markdownLib.render(parsed.content)}</div>`;\n' +
    '      } else {\n' +
    '        return `<div class="transclusion-error">Transclusion error: File "${filename}" not found.</div>`;\n' +
    '      }\n' +
    '    })\n' +
    '  );\n' +
    '});\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The first implementation of this filter exposed the frontmatter of transcluded notes, which was undesirable. This was fixed by using the `matter()` function to parse the file content and extract only the content part (excluding the frontmatter) before rendering it.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Implementation Details\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. The transclusion filter looks for all occurrences of `![[filename]]` in the content using a regex pattern.\n' +
    '2. For each match, it tries to find the corresponding file using the `findFile` function.\n' +
    '3. If the file is found, it reads the content, parses it using `matter()` to separate the frontmatter from the actual content, and renders only the content part.\n' +
    '4. The rendered content is wrapped in a `<div class="transclusion">` to allow for styling.\n' +
    '5. If the file is not found, it returns an error message.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The templates were also modified to include the transclusion filter in the filter chain:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{{ content | hideDataview | taggify | transclusion | link | safe}}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'By placing the `transclusion` filter before the `link` filter, we ensure that all transclusion links are processed first, then any remaining regular links are handled by the `link` filter.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Key Takeaways\n' +
    '\n' +
    '- When multiple pieces of code are processing the same syntax, the order in which they run matters.\n' +
    "- Overly broad regular expressions can lead to unexpected matches. It's important to be as specific as possible.\n" +
    '- Systematic debugging, like searching the full codebase for a pattern, can help uncover issues that may not be immediately apparent.\n' +
    "- When transcluding content, it's important to strip any metadata like frontmatter to avoid exposing internal configuration details.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'By understanding how the different parts of the Eleventy config interact and carefully adjusting the regex patterns and filter order, we were able to get the transclusion link handling working as intended, with proper handling of frontmatter.\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {\n' +
    '  // ... other configuration ...\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  // Transclusion transform\n' +
    '  eleventyConfig.addTransform("transclusion", function (content, outputPath) {\n' +
    '    // ... transclusion transform code ...\n' +
    '  });\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  // Link filter\n' +
    '  eleventyConfig.addFilter("link", function (str) {\n' +
    '    // ... link filter code ...\n' +
    '  });\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  // ... other transforms and filters ...\n' +

    'These formats present distinct characteristics:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### ELF32\n' +
    '\n' +
    '- Limited to 4GB virtual address space\n' +

    '\n' +
    "- ELF32's restricted address space creates predictable memory layouts\n" +

    '- Different NOP sled requirements due to address space size\n' +
    '- Varying buffer overflow exploitation complexity\n' +
    '\n' +
    "This distinction is crucial for exploitation because attack techniques must be specifically tailored to the target binary's ELF format, with ELF64 binaries typically presenting additional security challenges due to their enhanced protection mechanisms and larger address space."

    '# Fixing Daily Notes Sorting\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## The Problem\n' +
    "The daily notes in our digital garden weren't displaying in the correct order on the live site. Initially, we tried several approaches to fix this:\n" +
    '\n' +
    "1. **Frontmatter Dates**: We attempted to use the `created` dates in the frontmatter, but this wasn't reliable as not all notes had these dates set.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "2. **File System Dates**: We tried using the file system's modification dates, but this proved inconsistent across different environments.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '3. **Full Path Sorting**: Our first attempt at using `fileSlug` for sorting compared the entire path (e.g., "Daily Notes/2025-03-20"), which didn\'t work as expected because it was comparing the full path strings rather than just the dates.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## The Solution\n' +
    "The breakthrough came when we realized we needed to extract just the date portion from the fileSlug. Here's what we did:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '1.  ### **Path Check**:\n' +
    'We improved the check for daily notes by removing the leading slash from the path check:\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    "const isADailyNote = a.filePathStem.includes('Daily Notes/');\n" +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. ### **Date Extraction**: We modified the sorting to extract just the date part from the fileSlug:\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    "const dateA = a.fileSlug.split('/').pop();\n" +
    "const dateB = b.fileSlug.split('/').pop();\n" +
    'return dateB.localeCompare(dateA);\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This solution works because:\n' +
    '- It only sorts notes within the Daily Notes directory\n' +
    '- It extracts just the YYYY-MM-DD portion of the filename\n' +
    '- It uses `localeCompare` to properly sort the dates in reverse order (newest first)\n' +
    "- It's consistent across all environments since it relies on the filename format\n" +
    '\n' +
    '## Key Learnings\n' +
    '1. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best - using the filename format we already had in place\n' +
    "2. When sorting, it's important to compare exactly what we want to sort by (just the dates) rather than the full context\n" +
    '3. The `fileSlug` property in Eleventy can be manipulated to extract specific parts of the path\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Result\n' +
    'The daily notes are now properly sorted by date, with the newest notes appearing first, making it easier to navigate through the chronological content. '

  frontMatterContent: '# Lessons Learned from Nunjucks Template Development\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Introduction\n' +
    'This document summarizes the lessons learned while implementing a navigation component for daily notes using Nunjucks templates in an 11ty static site. The process involved several iterations to address compatibility issues with Nunjucks filters in the Vercel deployment environment.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Key Challenges\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Filter Availability\n' +
    'Not all filters commonly used in Nunjucks development are available in the default 11ty/Vercel environment. We encountered issues with:\n' +
    '- `push` filter: Not available for array manipulation\n' +
    '- `split` filter: Not available for string splitting\n' +
    '- `slice` filter: Implementation issues in the build environment\n' +
    '- `date` filter: Requires special configuration\n' +
    '- `substring` and `indexOf` methods: Not available on string objects\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. Error Detection\n' +
    'Build failures provided limited context about which filters were causing issues, requiring trial and error to identify problematic code.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Development vs. Production\n' +
    'Filters that work in local development may not work in the production build environment, necessitating thorough testing.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Solutions\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Using Core Filters\n' +
    'We simplified the implementation to rely only on core Nunjucks filters:\n' +
    '- `replace`: For string manipulation\n' +
    '- `includes`: For string pattern checking\n' +
    '- `length`: For array and string length checking\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. String Manipulation with `replace`\n' +
    'Instead of complex string operations, we used chained `replace` filters to transform date formats:\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{{ fileSlug | replace("2025-01-", "Jan ") | replace("-", " ") }}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Robust Comparison Logic\n' +
    'We implemented date comparisons without relying on advanced filters:\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{% if noteDate < currentDate %}\n' +
    '  {% if prevNote == null or noteDate > prevNote.fileSlug %}\n' +
    '    {% set prevNote = note %}\n' +
    '  {% endif %}\n' +
    '{% endif %}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Best Practices\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Stick to Core Filters\n' +
    'Use only the most basic Nunjucks filters that are guaranteed to be available:\n' +
    '- `replace`\n' +
    '- `length`\n' +
    '- `includes`\n' +
    '- Simple comparisons (`<`, `>`, `==`)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. Test in Production Environment\n' +
    "Don't assume filters that work locally will work in production. Test deployments frequently during development.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Favor Explicit Logic\n' +
    'Instead of relying on complex filter chains, break logic into explicit steps using basic conditionals and variables.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 4. Fallback Strategies\n' +
    'Develop with fallbacks in mind - if a filter might not be available, have an alternative approach ready.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 5. Simplify Date Formatting\n' +
    'For date formatting, use simple string replacements instead of relying on format filters.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Implementation Example\n' +
    'Our final implementation for displaying date navigation between daily notes:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{% if prevNote %}\n' +
    '  <a href="{{ prevNote.url }}" class="prev-day">\n' +
    '    <i icon-name="chevron-left"></i>\n' +
    '    {{ prevNote.fileSlug | replace("2025-03-", "Mar ") | replace("-", " ") }}\n' +
    '  </a>\n' +
    '{% endif %}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Conclusion\n' +
    'Working with Nunjucks in a deployment environment requires careful consideration of filter availability. By focusing on basic, widely-available filters and explicit control flow, we can create robust templates that work consistently across different environments.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Remember to document which filters are available in your specific environment to avoid future issues. '

    '## Git Operations\n' +
    'When moving files around in a git repository, there are several important considerations:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Checking Status\n' +
    'Always check `git status` before committing to see:\n' +
    '- Deleted files (shown in red)\n' +
    '- Untracked files (shown in green)\n' +
    '- Modified files (shown in yellow)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Staging Changes\n' +
    'When moving files, you need to stage both:\n' +
    '- The new files in their new location\n' +
    '- The deleted files in their old location\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Commit Messages\n' +
    'Write descriptive commit messages that include:\n' +
    '- What was changed\n' +
    '- Where files were moved (if applicable)\n' +
    '- Why the change was made\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Example of a good commit message:\n' +
    '```\n' +
    'Move files from raw_notes to notes directory: moved OSI Model.md and scp.md to root, Linux and Android files to their respective directories\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Best Practices\n' +
    '1. Always check for existing files in the destination before moving\n' +
    '2. Create directory structure before moving files into it\n' +
    '3. Use proper quoting around paths with spaces\n' +
    '4. Use PowerShell-specific commands instead of Unix-style commands\n' +
    '5. Review git status carefully before committing\n' +
    '6. Write descriptive commit messages\n' +
    '7. Stage both new and deleted files when moving files\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Common Pitfalls\n' +
    '1. Forgetting to check for existing files in destination\n' +
    '2. Not handling spaces in file/directory names properly\n' +
    '3. Using Unix commands in PowerShell\n' +
    '4. Not staging both new and deleted files\n' +
    '5. Writing vague commit messages\n' +
    '6. Not creating directory structure before moving files\n' +
    '7. Not checking git status before committing '

No I'm not a Philosophy major. but I think Philosophy is important, if not for its own sake, then as a way to improve our (critical) thinking in other fields like Computer Science.

    '2. NSA Director Timothy Haugh confirmed Signal has vulnerabilities and testified that the shared information "would be classified" had it been intercepted from Russia or China.\n' +
    "3. The administration's Russia negotiator, Steve Witkoff, was reportedly in Russia while participating in this chat.\n" +

    '\n' +
    'This incident perfectly illustrates the tension between convenience and security in our digital age. Yes, Signal offers end-to-end encryption, but proper operational security involves much more than just encrypted messages. It requires secure channels, proper classification protocols, and most importantly, not accidentally adding journalists to your war planning group chats.\n' +

    '\n' +
    'Today I made the following changes to the graph visualization:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. **Node Spawning Logic**: Implemented a new approach to node generation:\n' +
    '   - All nodes now spawn from the center of the graph\n' +
    '   - Nodes are grouped by their depth level (1, 2, 3)\n' +
    '   - Each depth group appears with a 500ms delay between groups\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. **Depth-Based Staggering**: Created a visual hierarchy in the node appearance:\n' +
    '   - Depth 1 nodes appear first\n' +

    '## Graph Center Positioning Fix\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Today I fixed an issue where nodes were incorrectly appearing from the top-left corner of the screen instead of from the center as intended:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. **Root Cause Analysis**:\n' +
    '   - Identified that the initial node positioning was being overridden during the rendering process\n' +
    "   - Discovered that D3's default behavior was causing nodes to shift before the staggered animation began\n" +
    '   - Found that the simulation was running automatically before we could set positions correctly\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. **Complete Position Control Implementation**:\n' +
    '   - Explicitly stopped the force simulation at initialization to prevent automatic movement\n' +
    '   - Set alpha to 0 initially to keep nodes stationary until intentionally moved\n' +
    '   - Force-positioned all visual elements (nodes, labels, links) at exact center coordinates\n' +
    '   - Added immediate position updates within the staggered animation sequence\n' +
    '\n' +
    '3. **Visual Enhancements**:\n' +
    '   - Made labels initially invisible, fading them in as their nodes appear\n' +
    '   - Created a more controlled expansion from center effect\n' +
    '   - Implemented direct position control during the animation sequence\n' +
    '   - Ensured links follow nodes properly during the animation\n' +
    '\n' +
    '4. **Animation Improvements**:\n' +
    '   - Created rapid-fire node population within each depth level (20ms intervals)\n' +
    '   - Implemented 800ms pauses between depth groups for visual clarity\n' +
    '   - Increased random offsets for more dramatic, energetic movement\n' +
    '   - Applied higher alpha values to make nodes "pop" into place\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This fix ensures nodes now properly spawn from the center of the graph in a visually appealing, intentional pattern, rather than appearing from the top-left corner of the screen. '

    '# Fixing Wiki-Link Handling in Eleventy.js\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This document outlines the changes made to `.eleventy.js` to fix issues with wiki-link handling in the Digital Garden.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '> [!note] Additional Fixes\n' +
    '> This document has been updated to include an additional fix for the root file path resolution issue documented [[202503261854#6. Fixing Root File Resolution|here]].\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Issues Fixed\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. Wiki-links using permalinks (like `[[/daily-notes/|Daily Notes]]`) were causing build errors\n' +
    '2. The system was incorrectly prepending the base path (`src/site/notes/`) multiple times\n' +
    '3. Automatic creation of stub files for missing links was causing bloat and confusion\n' +
    '4. File read operations on directories were causing EISDIR errors\n' +
    '5. A permalink format issue in one file was causing file/directory conflicts\n' +
    '6. Wiki-links to root files were incorrectly resolving to `/notes/filename` instead of using the permalink\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Detailed Changes\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Adding Special Handling for Permalink Wiki-Links\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** Links in the format `[[/daily-notes/|Title]]` were being treated as file paths with slashes instead of as permalinks.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'function getAnchorAttributes(filePath, linkTitle) {\n' +
    '  let fileName = filePath.replaceAll("&amp;", "&");\n' +
    '  let header = "";\n' +
    '  let headerLinkPath = "";\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  if (filePath.includes("#")) {\n' +
    '    [fileName, header] = filePath.split("#");\n' +
    '    headerLinkPath = `#${headerToId(header)}`;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  let noteIcon = process.env.NOTE_ICON_DEFAULT;\n' +
    '  const title = linkTitle ? linkTitle : fileName;\n' +
    '  let permalink = `/notes/${slugify(fileName)}`;\n' +
    '  let deadLink = false;\n' +
    '  // ... rest of function\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'function getAnchorAttributes(filePath, linkTitle) {\n' +
    '  let fileName = filePath.replaceAll("&amp;", "&");\n' +
    '  let header = "";\n' +
    '  let headerLinkPath = "";\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  // Handle permalinks in wiki-links\n' +
    "  if (filePath.startsWith('/') && filePath.endsWith('/')) {\n" +
    '    // This is a permalink-style link, extract without the slashes\n' +
    '    const permalinkPath = filePath.slice(1, -1);\n' +
    '    let noteIcon = process.env.NOTE_ICON_DEFAULT;\n' +
    '    const title = linkTitle ? linkTitle : permalinkPath;\n' +
    '    \n' +
    '    // Simply use the permalink directly\n' +
    '    return {\n' +
    '      attributes: {\n' +
    '        "class": "internal-link",\n' +
    '        "target": "",\n' +
    '        "data-note-icon": noteIcon,\n' +
    '        "href": `${filePath}`,\n' +
    '      },\n' +
    '      innerHTML: title,\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  if (filePath.includes("#")) {\n' +
    '    [fileName, header] = filePath.split("#");\n' +
    '    headerLinkPath = `#${headerToId(header)}`;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '  // ... rest of function\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Explanation:** This change adds special handling for wiki-links that use the permalink format (`[[/permalink/|Title]]`). When detected, it immediately returns the correct attributes without attempting to resolve the file path, preventing errors when trying to read directories.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. Preventing Duplicate Path Prefixes\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** The system was incorrectly adding `src/site/notes/` to paths that already included this prefix.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '  // If the path already contains a directory structure, treat it differently\n' +
    "  if (fileName.includes('/')) {\n" +
    "    // Try to get or create the file if it doesn't exist\n" +
    '    try {\n' +
    '      fullPath = getOrCreateNoteStub(fileName);\n' +
    '    } catch (e) {\n' +
    '      fullPath = fileName.endsWith(".md") \n' +
    '        ? `${startPath}${fileName}` \n' +
    '        : `${startPath}${fileName}.md`;\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    "  // Make sure we don't duplicate the base path\n" +
    "  if (fileName.startsWith('src/site/notes/')) {\n" +
    "    fileName = fileName.replace('src/site/notes/', '');\n" +
    '  }\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  // If the path already contains a directory structure, treat it differently\n' +
    "  if (fileName.includes('/')) {\n" +
    "    // Don't attempt to create stub files, just construct the path\n" +
    '    fullPath = fileName.endsWith(".md") \n' +
    '      ? `${startPath}${fileName}` \n' +
    '      : `${startPath}${fileName}.md`;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Explanation:** This change checks if the file path already includes the base path and removes it if found. This prevents file paths like `src/site/notes/src/site/notes/file.md` which were causing errors.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Removing Automatic Stub File Creation\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** The system was automatically creating stub files for links that pointed to non-existent files.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '// Helper function to handle missing files by creating stubs\n' +
    'function getOrCreateNoteStub(filePath) {\n' +
    '  const startPath = "./src/site/notes/";\n' +
    '  const fullPath = filePath.endsWith(".md") \n' +
    '    ? `${startPath}${filePath}` \n' +
    '    : `${startPath}${filePath}.md`;\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  try {\n' +
    '    // Check if file exists first\n' +
    '    fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");\n' +
    '    return fullPath; // Return the path if it exists\n' +
    '  } catch (e) {\n' +
    "    // File doesn't exist, try to create a stub\n" +
    '    try {\n' +
    '      const fileName = filePath.split("/").pop();\n' +
    '      const dirPath = fullPath.substring(0, fullPath.lastIndexOf("/"));\n' +
    '      \n' +
    "      // Create directory if it doesn't exist\n" +
    '      if (!fs.existsSync(dirPath)) {\n' +
    '        fs.mkdirSync(dirPath, { recursive: true });\n' +
    '      }\n' +
    '      \n' +
    '      // Create a minimal stub file\n' +
    '      const stubContent = `---\n' +
    'dg-publish: true\n' +
    'permalink: /${slugify(fileName)}/\n' +
    '---\n' +
    '# ${fileName}\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This is a stub page. Content will be added later.\n' +
    '`;\n' +
    "      // Only write the file if it doesn't exist\n" +
    '      if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {\n' +
    '        fs.writeFileSync(fullPath, stubContent);\n' +
    '        console.log(`Created stub file: ${fullPath}`);\n' +
    '      }\n' +
    '      return fullPath;\n' +
    '    } catch (stubError) {\n' +
    '      console.warn(`Error creating stub file: ${stubError.message}`);\n' +
    '      throw e; // Re-throw the original error\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '// Helper function to handle missing files by creating stubs\n' +
    'function getOrCreateNoteStub(filePath) {\n' +
    '  const startPath = "./src/site/notes/";\n' +
    '  const fullPath = filePath.endsWith(".md") \n' +
    '    ? `${startPath}${filePath}` \n' +
    '    : `${startPath}${filePath}.md`;\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  try {\n' +
    '    // Check if file exists first\n' +
    '    fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");\n' +
    '    return fullPath; // Return the path if it exists\n' +
    '  } catch (e) {\n' +
    "    // File doesn't exist, but don't create a stub - just return the path\n" +
    '    // This disables the automatic stub file creation\n' +
    '    console.warn(`File not found: ${fullPath}`);\n' +
    '    return fullPath;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Explanation:** This change eliminates the automatic creation of stub files, which was causing confusion and bloat in the repository. Now it simply logs a warning and returns the path.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 4. Adding File Existence Check Before Reading\n' +
    '\n' +
    "**Issue:** The system was attempting to read files that didn't exist, causing errors.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '  const file = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");\n' +
    '  const frontMatter = matter(file);\n' +
    '  \n' +
    '  // Use permalink from frontmatter if available\n' +
    '  if (frontMatter.data.permalink) {\n' +
    '    permalink = frontMatter.data.permalink;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '  // ... more code\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '  // Only try to read the file if it exists\n' +
    '  if (fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {\n' +
    '    const file = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");\n' +
    '    const frontMatter = matter(file);\n' +
    '    \n' +
    '    // Use permalink from frontmatter if available\n' +
    '    if (frontMatter.data.permalink) {\n' +
    '      permalink = frontMatter.data.permalink;\n' +
    '    }\n' +
    '    // ... more code\n' +
    '  } else {\n' +
    '    console.warn(`File not found: ${fullPath}`);\n' +
    '    deadLink = true;\n' +
    '  }\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Explanation:** This change adds a check to verify that a file exists before attempting to read it, preventing file system errors.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 5. Fixing Permalink Format in a File\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Issue:** The file `202503261845.md` had a permalink without the standard leading and trailing slashes, causing path conflicts.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```yaml\n' +
    '---\n' +
    'dg-publish: false\n' +
    'tags:\n' +
    '  - programming-language\n' +
    'permalink: java\n' +
    'hide: true\n' +
    'aliases:\n' +
    '  - java\n' +
    '---\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**After:**\n' +
    '```yaml\n' +
    '---\n' +
    'dg-publish: false\n' +
    'tags:\n' +
    '  - programming-language\n' +
    'permalink: /java/\n' +
    'hide: true\n' +
    'aliases:\n' +
    '  - java\n' +
    '---\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    "**Explanation:** This change standardizes the permalink format to include leading and trailing slashes, consistent with the rest of the site's URL structure. This prevents a conflict where both a file and directory were trying to be created at the same path (`dist/java`).\n" +
    '\n' +
    '### 6. Fixing Root File Resolution\n' +
    '\n' +
    "**Issue:** Wiki-links to files in the root directory (e.g., `[[Daily Notes|Daily Notes Archive]]`) were incorrectly resolving to `/notes/daily-notes` instead of using the file's permalink (`/daily-notes/`).\n" +
    '\n' +
    '#### Problem in `getAnchorAttributes` Function\n' +
    '\n' +
    'First, the issue was thought to be in the `getAnchorAttributes` function, and we added a check for direct file matches in the root directory:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    '// Check for exact file match in the root directory first\n' +
    "const rootFilePath = `${startPath}${fileName}${fileName.endsWith('.md') ? '' : '.md'}`;\n" +
    'if (fs.existsSync(rootFilePath)) {\n' +
    '  // Direct match in root directory\n' +
    '  fullPath = rootFilePath;\n' +
    "} else if (fileName.includes('/')) {\n" +
    '  // If the path already contains a directory structure...\n' +
    '}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    "However, this change alone didn't resolve the issue.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '#### Actual Fix in `link` Filter Function\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The critical issue was in the `link` filter function, which processes wiki-links. The function was incorrectly finding files during the recursive search process:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '**Before:**\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'eleventyConfig.addFilter("link", function (str) {\n' +
    '  return (\n' +
    '    str &&\n' +
    '    str.replace(/\\[\\[(.*?)(?:\\|(.*?))?\\]\\]/g, function (match, fileLink, linkTitle) {\n' +
    '      // ...other checks...\n' +
    '      \n' +
    '      // Try to find the file by alias or by searching through the file structure\n' +

    '      let foundFilePath = null;\n' +
    '      \n' +
    '      try {\n' +
    '        const files = fs.readdirSync(startPath, { recursive: true });\n' +
    '        \n' +
    '        // First try to find a direct match by filename\n' +
    '        const exactMatch = files.find(file => {\n' +
    '          return file.toLowerCase() === `${fileLink.toLowerCase()}.md` || \n' +
    '                 file.toLowerCase() === fileLink.toLowerCase();\n' +

    '# Fixing Transclusion Link Handling in Eleventy.js\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This note documents the process of debugging and fixing an issue with transclusion link handling in the Digital Garden Eleventy setup.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Problem Statement\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Transclusion links using the `![[filename]]` syntax were not being processed correctly. Instead of transcluding the content of the referenced file, they were being rendered as regular internal links.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Debugging Steps\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. The `link` filter in `.eleventy.js` was modified to prioritize handling transclusion links before other link types. However, this change alone did not resolve the issue, indicating something else was interfering.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. A `grep` search was performed across the codebase to find other code that might be processing the `![[filename]]` syntax. This revealed that the `obsidian-image-embeds` transform was also capturing these links.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## The scenic path to identifying the *real* problem\n' +
    '\n' +
    'initially, I thought that the `obsidian-image-embeds` transform, intended to handle Obsidian-style image links like `![[image.png]]`, had a regular expression that was too broad:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```js\n' +
    '/!\\[\\[(.*?\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|webp))\\]\\]/gi\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The `(.*?\\.` part of this regex was matching any characters up until a dot, even if those characters included square brackets `[]`. This caused it to accidentally match non-image transclusion links like `![[note.md]]`.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Since this transform ran after the `link` filter, it was overriding the transclusion link handling.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Proposed Solution\n' +
    '\n' +
    'To fix this, the regex in `obsidian-image-embeds` was modified to be more specific:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```js\n' +
    '/!\\[\\[([^[\\]]*\\.(?:png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|webp))\\]\\]/gi\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The key change is `([^[\\]]*\\.` which ensures it only matches filenames without `[]` characters. This prevents it from capturing `![[note.md]]` type links.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "After deploying the changes, it turned out this wasn't the issue, because `![[file]]` syntax was being rendered as an internal link, and ignoring the ! symbol. Maybe it's the filters and transforms?\n" +
    '\n' +
    '# adding a explicit transclusion filter\n' +
    ' a new `transclusion` filter was created to handle the `![[filename]]` syntax before the `link` filter:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```js\n' +
    'eleventyConfig.addFilter("transclusion", function (str) {\n' +
    '  return (\n' +
    '    str &&\n' +
    '    str.replace(/!\\[\\[(.*?)\\]\\]/g, (match, filename) => {\n' +
    '      const filePath = findFile(filename);\n' +
    '      if (filePath) {\n' +
    "        const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');\n" +
    '        \n' +
    '        // Parse the frontmatter and content\n' +
    '        const parsed = matter(fileContent);\n' +
    '        \n' +
    '        // Render only the content part (excluding frontmatter)\n' +
    '        return `<div class="transclusion">${markdownLib.render(parsed.content)}</div>`;\n' +
    '      } else {\n' +
    '        return `<div class="transclusion-error">Transclusion error: File "${filename}" not found.</div>`;\n' +
    '      }\n' +
    '    })\n' +
    '  );\n' +
    '});\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The first implementation of this filter exposed the frontmatter of transcluded notes, which was undesirable. This was fixed by using the `matter()` function to parse the file content and extract only the content part (excluding the frontmatter) before rendering it.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Implementation Details\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. The transclusion filter looks for all occurrences of `![[filename]]` in the content using a regex pattern.\n' +
    '2. For each match, it tries to find the corresponding file using the `findFile` function.\n' +
    '3. If the file is found, it reads the content, parses it using `matter()` to separate the frontmatter from the actual content, and renders only the content part.\n' +
    '4. The rendered content is wrapped in a `<div class="transclusion">` to allow for styling.\n' +
    '5. If the file is not found, it returns an error message.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The templates were also modified to include the transclusion filter in the filter chain:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{{ content | hideDataview | taggify | transclusion | link | safe}}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'By placing the `transclusion` filter before the `link` filter, we ensure that all transclusion links are processed first, then any remaining regular links are handled by the `link` filter.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Key Takeaways\n' +
    '\n' +
    '- When multiple pieces of code are processing the same syntax, the order in which they run matters.\n' +
    "- Overly broad regular expressions can lead to unexpected matches. It's important to be as specific as possible.\n" +
    '- Systematic debugging, like searching the full codebase for a pattern, can help uncover issues that may not be immediately apparent.\n' +
    "- When transcluding content, it's important to strip any metadata like frontmatter to avoid exposing internal configuration details.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'By understanding how the different parts of the Eleventy config interact and carefully adjusting the regex patterns and filter order, we were able to get the transclusion link handling working as intended, with proper handling of frontmatter.\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    'module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {\n' +
    '  // ... other configuration ...\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  // Transclusion transform\n' +
    '  eleventyConfig.addTransform("transclusion", function (content, outputPath) {\n' +
    '    // ... transclusion transform code ...\n' +
    '  });\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  // Link filter\n' +
    '  eleventyConfig.addFilter("link", function (str) {\n' +
    '    // ... link filter code ...\n' +
    '  });\n' +
    '\n' +
    '  // ... other transforms and filters ...\n' +

    '# Fixing Daily Notes Sorting\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## The Problem\n' +
    "The daily notes in our digital garden weren't displaying in the correct order on the live site. Initially, we tried several approaches to fix this:\n" +
    '\n' +
    "1. **Frontmatter Dates**: We attempted to use the `created` dates in the frontmatter, but this wasn't reliable as not all notes had these dates set.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "2. **File System Dates**: We tried using the file system's modification dates, but this proved inconsistent across different environments.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '3. **Full Path Sorting**: Our first attempt at using `fileSlug` for sorting compared the entire path (e.g., "Daily Notes/2025-03-20"), which didn\'t work as expected because it was comparing the full path strings rather than just the dates.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## The Solution\n' +
    "The breakthrough came when we realized we needed to extract just the date portion from the fileSlug. Here's what we did:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '1.  ### **Path Check**:\n' +
    'We improved the check for daily notes by removing the leading slash from the path check:\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    "const isADailyNote = a.filePathStem.includes('Daily Notes/');\n" +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. ### **Date Extraction**: We modified the sorting to extract just the date part from the fileSlug:\n' +
    '```javascript\n' +
    "const dateA = a.fileSlug.split('/').pop();\n" +
    "const dateB = b.fileSlug.split('/').pop();\n" +
    'return dateB.localeCompare(dateA);\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    'This solution works because:\n' +
    '- It only sorts notes within the Daily Notes directory\n' +
    '- It extracts just the YYYY-MM-DD portion of the filename\n' +
    '- It uses `localeCompare` to properly sort the dates in reverse order (newest first)\n' +
    "- It's consistent across all environments since it relies on the filename format\n" +
    '\n' +
    '## Key Learnings\n' +
    '1. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best - using the filename format we already had in place\n' +
    "2. When sorting, it's important to compare exactly what we want to sort by (just the dates) rather than the full context\n" +
    '3. The `fileSlug` property in Eleventy can be manipulated to extract specific parts of the path\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Result\n' +
    'The daily notes are now properly sorted by date, with the newest notes appearing first, making it easier to navigate through the chronological content. '

  graphExclude: undefined,
  frontMatterContent: '# Lessons Learned from Nunjucks Template Development\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Introduction\n' +
    'This document summarizes the lessons learned while implementing a navigation component for daily notes using Nunjucks templates in an 11ty static site. The process involved several iterations to address compatibility issues with Nunjucks filters in the Vercel deployment environment.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Key Challenges\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Filter Availability\n' +
    'Not all filters commonly used in Nunjucks development are available in the default 11ty/Vercel environment. We encountered issues with:\n' +
    '- `push` filter: Not available for array manipulation\n' +
    '- `split` filter: Not available for string splitting\n' +
    '- `slice` filter: Implementation issues in the build environment\n' +
    '- `date` filter: Requires special configuration\n' +
    '- `substring` and `indexOf` methods: Not available on string objects\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. Error Detection\n' +
    'Build failures provided limited context about which filters were causing issues, requiring trial and error to identify problematic code.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Development vs. Production\n' +
    'Filters that work in local development may not work in the production build environment, necessitating thorough testing.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Solutions\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Using Core Filters\n' +
    'We simplified the implementation to rely only on core Nunjucks filters:\n' +
    '- `replace`: For string manipulation\n' +
    '- `includes`: For string pattern checking\n' +
    '- `length`: For array and string length checking\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. String Manipulation with `replace`\n' +
    'Instead of complex string operations, we used chained `replace` filters to transform date formats:\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{{ fileSlug | replace("2025-01-", "Jan ") | replace("-", " ") }}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Robust Comparison Logic\n' +
    'We implemented date comparisons without relying on advanced filters:\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{% if noteDate < currentDate %}\n' +
    '  {% if prevNote == null or noteDate > prevNote.fileSlug %}\n' +
    '    {% set prevNote = note %}\n' +
    '  {% endif %}\n' +
    '{% endif %}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Best Practices\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 1. Stick to Core Filters\n' +
    'Use only the most basic Nunjucks filters that are guaranteed to be available:\n' +
    '- `replace`\n' +
    '- `length`\n' +
    '- `includes`\n' +
    '- Simple comparisons (`<`, `>`, `==`)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 2. Test in Production Environment\n' +
    "Don't assume filters that work locally will work in production. Test deployments frequently during development.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '### 3. Favor Explicit Logic\n' +
    'Instead of relying on complex filter chains, break logic into explicit steps using basic conditionals and variables.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 4. Fallback Strategies\n' +
    'Develop with fallbacks in mind - if a filter might not be available, have an alternative approach ready.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### 5. Simplify Date Formatting\n' +
    'For date formatting, use simple string replacements instead of relying on format filters.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Implementation Example\n' +
    'Our final implementation for displaying date navigation between daily notes:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '```njk\n' +
    '{% if prevNote %}\n' +
    '  <a href="{{ prevNote.url }}" class="prev-day">\n' +
    '    <i icon-name="chevron-left"></i>\n' +
    '    {{ prevNote.fileSlug | replace("2025-03-", "Mar ") | replace("-", " ") }}\n' +
    '  </a>\n' +
    '{% endif %}\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Conclusion\n' +
    'Working with Nunjucks in a deployment environment requires careful consideration of filter availability. By focusing on basic, widely-available filters and explicit control flow, we can create robust templates that work consistently across different environments.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Remember to document which filters are available in your specific environment to avoid future issues. '

    '# Lessons Learned from File Operations\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## PowerShell vs Unix Commands\n' +
    'When working with file operations in PowerShell, there are several important differences from Unix commands that need to be considered:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Command Chaining\n' +
    '- **Bad**: Using Unix-style command chaining with `&&`\n' +
    '  ```powershell\n' +
    '  mv file1.md file2.md && mv file3.md file4.md\n' +
    '  ```\n' +
    "- **Good**: Run commands separately or use PowerShell's semicolon\n" +
    '  ```powershell\n' +
    '  Move-Item file1.md file2.md; Move-Item file3.md file4.md\n' +
    '  ```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Directory Creation\n' +
    '- **Bad**: Using Unix-style `mkdir -p`\n' +
    '  ```powershell\n' +
    '  mkdir -p "src/site/notes/Linux/etc files"\n' +
    '  ```\n' +
    "- **Good**: Using PowerShell's `New-Item` command\n" +
    '  ```powershell\n' +
    '  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "src/site/notes/Linux/etc files" -Force\n' +
    '  ```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### File Movement\n' +
    '- **Bad**: Using Unix-style `mv` command\n' +
    '  ```powershell\n' +
    '  mv "file with spaces.md" "new location/"\n' +
    '  ```\n' +
    "- **Good**: Using PowerShell's `Move-Item` command with proper quoting\n" +
    '  ```powershell\n' +
    '  Move-Item "file with spaces.md" "new location/"\n' +
    '  ```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Git Operations\n' +
    'When moving files around in a git repository, there are several important considerations:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Checking Status\n' +
    'Always check `git status` before committing to see:\n' +
    '- Deleted files (shown in red)\n' +
    '- Untracked files (shown in green)\n' +
    '- Modified files (shown in yellow)\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Staging Changes\n' +
    'When moving files, you need to stage both:\n' +
    '- The new files in their new location\n' +
    '- The deleted files in their old location\n' +
    '\n' +
    '### Commit Messages\n' +
    'Write descriptive commit messages that include:\n' +
    '- What was changed\n' +
    '- Where files were moved (if applicable)\n' +
    '- Why the change was made\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Example of a good commit message:\n' +
    '```\n' +
    'Move files from raw_notes to notes directory: moved OSI Model.md and scp.md to root, Linux and Android files to their respective directories\n' +
    '```\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Best Practices\n' +
    '1. Always check for existing files in the destination before moving\n' +
    '2. Create directory structure before moving files into it\n' +
    '3. Use proper quoting around paths with spaces\n' +
    '4. Use PowerShell-specific commands instead of Unix-style commands\n' +
    '5. Review git status carefully before committing\n' +
    '6. Write descriptive commit messages\n' +
    '7. Stage both new and deleted files when moving files\n' +
    '\n' +
    '## Common Pitfalls\n' +
    '1. Forgetting to check for existing files in destination\n' +
    '2. Not handling spaces in file/directory names properly\n' +
    '3. Using Unix commands in PowerShell\n' +
    '4. Not staging both new and deleted files\n' +
    '5. Writing vague commit messages\n' +
    '6. Not creating directory structure before moving files\n' +
    '7. Not checking git status before committing '

    'Traversing fire disperses fires in width by successive changes in direction, but not elevation. It is delivered against a wide target with minimal detph. When engaging a wide target requiring traversing fire, the gunner should select successive aiming points throughout the target area. These aiming points should be close enough together to ensure adequate target  coverage. However they do not need to be so close that they waste ammunition by concentrating a heavy volume of fire in a small area.\n' +

I got the idea from Geoffrey Huntley's article on [asking Cursor to write rules](https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/).

Perhaps the next best thing is to critically analyze the lessons learned from the AI model and ask more questions. For example, in [[Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI|AI/Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI| The Solution]] I could ask "how does removing the leading slash improve the check for daily notes?" because that's exactly the kind of question I'd expect anyone reading this to ask, among other things. \n` +
