in a password cracking attack, the attacker gets a copy of the encrypted or hashed password representations either from a target machine or by sniffing them off of the network. The attacker then cracks the passwords by formulating a guess, encrypting or hashing the guess, and then comparing the result to the actual password's encrypted or hashed value. If the encrypted guess equals the encrypted password, the attacker now has a usable password.
