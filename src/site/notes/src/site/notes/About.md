This is basically my 2nd brain. Collecting my thoughts and notes and structuring it in a way that's easy to share to the world. 

This site is created using [[Obsidian/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] , the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), and deployed with [vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

When possible I'll use [Link Archive](https://github.com/tomzorz/obsidian-link-archive) [🏛️](https://web.archive.org/web/20250314/https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.0.3/Obsidian-1.0.3.AppImage)for external URLs to curb [[Link Rot\|Link Rot]].
