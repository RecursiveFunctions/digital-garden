# Vector Components

Vector components are projections of a vector onto coordinate axes that allow us to break down complex directional quantities into simpler [[scalar]] parts

Mathematically, vector components are defined through projection operations. In a two-dimensional system, given a vector a⃗a with magnitude ∣a⃗∣∣a∣ and angle ϕϕ relative to the x-axis, the components are:

$$
a_x &= || \cos(\phi) \\
a_y &= |\vec{a}| \sin(\phi)
$$

$a_x$ = $|\vec{a}|$ || $\cos(\phi)$
$a_y$ = $|\vec{a}|$ $\sin(\phi)$
