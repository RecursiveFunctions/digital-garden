# On Anonymity and threat models
[Spider-Man, Pikachu, and the Joker lead a protest against the regime as Batman stands in solidarity in Ankara, 1986 (Colorized) : r/fakehistoryporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakehistoryporn/comments/1jl5mn5/comment/mk5tr6g/)

>Posting actual images is risky for me, I was also in the protests and if i spread actual images it can drag me to jail. A photographer friend of mine already detained for sharing pictures on twitter.

>>yeah that's also true. you should probably create an account with the tor browser, it uses a fuck ton of vpns, really great for privacy.

When your [[threat model]] includes your literal government, what steps can you take to protect yourself?

In that reddit thread, OP posted an AI generated image of an actual protest that happened in Turkey (hence the subreddit name). Supposedly the risk of disseminating real photos is so high that they could be jailed for doing so. Others chime in with suggestions to protect themselves like using [[202503291238|tor]] (which does not, in fact, use a fuckton of vpns), or deleting the metadata off the real images before sharing them. So how can one go about doing this stuff and more to protect their identity? I'll start with the first two pieces of advice given on the thread. Even if this was totally fabricated (because [[202503291022|everyone lies on the internet]] ).

![[202503291241]]

This reddit thread led me down a privacy rabbit-hole and inspired me to spend an afternoon making a little python program. All in all, not a bad way to pass the time. sure beats doom scrolling. 

There's actually a lot more one could do to protect themselves online but I'll come back to this eventually as I continue importing my notes.
