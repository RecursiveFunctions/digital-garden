# On Anonymity and threat models
[Spider-Man, Pikachu, and the Joker lead a protest against the regime as Batman stands in solidarity in Ankara, 1986 (Colorized) : r/fakehistoryporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakehistoryporn/comments/1jl5mn5/comment/mk5tr6g/)

>Posting actual images is risky for me, I was also in the protests and if i spread actual images it can drag me to jail. A photographer friend of mine already detained for sharing pictures on twitter.

>>yeah that's also true. you should probably create an account with the tor browser, it uses a fuck ton of vpns, really great for privacy.

When your [[threat model]] includes your literal government, what steps can you take to protect yourself?

In that reddit thread, OP posted an AI generated image of an actual protest that happened in Turkey (hence the subreddit name). Supposedly the risk of disseminating real photos is so high that they could be jailed for doing so. Others chime in with suggestions to protect themselves like using [[202503291238|tor]] (which does not, in fact, use a fuckton of vpns), or deleting the metadata off the real images before sharing them. So how can one go about doing this stuff and more to protect their identity? I'll start with the first two pieces of advice given on the thread. Even if this was totally fabricated (because [[202503291022|everyone lies on the internet]] ). 

![[202503291238]]

![[202503291241]]

This reddit thread led me down a privacy rabbit-hole and inspired me to spend an afternoon making a little python program. All in all, not a bad way to pass the time. sure beats doom scrolling. 

There's actually a lot more one could do to protect themselves online but I'll come back to this eventually as I continue importing my notes.

## Graph Generation Fixes

Today I fixed issues with the graph generation in the digital garden:

1. **Module Loading Issues**: Fixed problems with React and D3.js modules not loading properly by:
   - Removed React dependency completely and switched to vanilla JavaScript
   - Added D3.js from a CDN instead of trying to load from node_modules
   - Created direct DOM manipulation instead of using React components

2. **CSS Issues**: Created an empty `backlinks.css` file to resolve 404 errors

3. **Data Structure**: Added a graph.js file in the _data directory to ensure graph data is being correctly generated and passed to templates

4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the graph generation code to provide better diagnostics

5. **Graph Rendering Enhancements**:
   - Added proper node-link relationship handling to ensure correct connections
   - Implemented hover effects to highlight connected nodes and links
   - Added zoom and pan capability for better navigation
   - Set proper dimensions for graph containers
   - Fixed edge rendering to correctly display connections
   - Added bounds to keep nodes within the visible area
   - Added fallback for empty or error states

6. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Optimized force simulation parameters for faster convergence
   - Added collision detection to prevent node overlap
   - Improved visual styles for better readability

7. **Connection Fixes**:
   - Fixed node ID mapping to ensure edges properly connect to their nodes
   - Enhanced the graph link processing to correctly handle numeric IDs
   - Added detailed logging for edge creation to aid in debugging
   - Implemented proper node lookup by ID for reliable connections

8. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Increased the canvas size to provide more space for nodes
   - Enhanced node spacing with stronger repulsion forces
   - Improved text contrast with light text on dark background
   - Added tooltips showing additional node information
   - Implemented more attractive color scheme with light blue nodes
   - Added visual feedback on node hover (size increase, color change)
   - Improved edge visibility with thicker lines on hover

9. **Advanced Visual Styling**:
   - Implemented the Catppuccin Mocha color theme for a more polished, modern appearance
   - Added color-coding for nodes based on their group/category
   - Improved tooltip styling with shadows and better formatting
   - Enhanced the container with rounded corners and subtle borders
   - Refined text styling with better fonts and readability

10. **Depth Control Functionality**:
    - Fixed the depth slider to properly filter connections by depth
    - Implemented a depth-based graph filtering system using breadth-first search
    - Added click handling on nodes to set them as the central point for depth filtering
    - Store original graph data to allow filtering without requiring a reload
    - Enhanced the slider appearance and controls for better usability

These changes should make the graph visualization more reliable, performant, and user-friendly going forward.
