I originally went with the digital garden plugin so I didn't have to think about the underlying framework. Ironically, once I decided I wanted something like my daily notes being [[AI/Fixing Daily Notes sort order with AI.md|programmatically sorted and displayed from newest to oldest]], I spent more time screwing around with my site instead of putting up more notes. but is that such a bad thing? I suppose it just takes my learning in a different direction.
