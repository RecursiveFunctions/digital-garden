Currently having trouble making a transcluded note appear in the [[src/site/notes/About|About]] page. ideally it should like this 

```markdown
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]]
```
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]] 

###### The issue
I think the issue is that my about page and note I'm trying to transclude are in different folders. Either that or I just don't know how to put in the correct path leading to the note I want to transclude. When I transclude notes and view it offline in my vault it looks just fine.
```markdown
![[src/site/notes/About|About]]
```
![[src/site/notes/About|About]]

The above should look like this
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](/img/user/raw_notes/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250322211428.png)

###### Troubleshooting
okay obviously the above links are not working when displayed on the live site.
For the image, when properly linked should show like this
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](/img/user/raw_notes/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250322211428.png)

I can see the path for my image works when I start from `site/` as my root folder. 
so then... maybe
```markdown
![[notes/About.md]]
```
This should work

![[notes/About.md]]

------------
###### Still Wrong
I was trying to copy the syntax from my [[scp]] page
```markdown
![Pasted image 20221111014337.png](/img/user/raw_notes/Images/Pasted%20image%2020221111014337.png)
```
where that produces the correct image
![Pasted image 20221111014337.png](/img/user/raw_notes/Images/Pasted%20image%2020221111014337.png)

---------------

###### I think I see the problem
I need to use single brackets
```markdown
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](img\user\raw_notes\Images\Pasted image 20250322211428.png)

```
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](img\user\raw_notes\Images\Pasted image 20250322211428.png)

###### And the other problem
just noticed there's a leading slash, and the slashes in the path are facing the other way T_T
```markdown
![Pasted image 20250322211428.png](/img/user/raw_notes/Images/Pasted image 20250322211428.png)
```
