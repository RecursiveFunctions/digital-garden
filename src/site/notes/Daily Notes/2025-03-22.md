Currently having trouble making a transcluded note appear in the [[src/site/notes/About|About]] page. ideally it should like this 

```markdown
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]]
```
![[2025-03-21#Transitioning from supermemo]] 

###### The issue
I think the issue is that my about page and note I'm trying to transclude are in different folders. Either that or I just don't know how to put in the correct path leading to the note I want to transclude. When I transclude notes and view it offline in my vault it looks just fine.
```markdown
![[src/site/notes/About|About]]
```
![[src/site/notes/About|About]]

The above should look like this
