I came across a bunch of my old notes from my college days. Might be a good idea to put em up here.

I found a way to get a certain webpage to show all rows from a query when I save it. It's kind of stupid but it works.
- zoom out the webpage so you can see all the columns
- right click -> save as -> single html page

simply printing the page doesn't work because not all rows are printed.
saving it as html doesn't work either because it excludes the actual query.
