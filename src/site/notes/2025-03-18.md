Just  learned about .omg.lol domains. I think using these with the digital garden plugin and vercel I could easily create websites for friends and family who've been toyin with the idea of having their own site but find the technical aspect daunting (even for WYSIWYG sites) to even start. 

They'd just need obsidian (on phone or laptop). I could probably just use my own github and vercel accounts to deploy their sites, until/unless the site(s) evolve into a serious project for them.
