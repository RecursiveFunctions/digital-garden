# **vector**Â 
A vector describes a shift in space. We can represent it with an arrow like so: $\vec{v}$
vectors consist of [[vector components]]. typically represented with angle brackets like `<4,2>`.
## $\vec{v}$

A vector is different from a coordinate because a vector describes a shift in space whereas a coordinate is a location. 

It looks like this `$\vec{v}$` in latex
