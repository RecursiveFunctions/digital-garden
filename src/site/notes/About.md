This is basically my [[202503280325|2nd brain]]. Collecting my thoughts and notes and structuring it in a way that's easy to share to the world. Since digital gardens are a continuous work in progress, expect a lot of broken links as you meander through here. But over time those links will be filled in and fleshed out as I eventually port over my knowledge base. 

This site is created using [[Obsidian]] , the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), and deployed with [vercel](https://vercel.com/).
