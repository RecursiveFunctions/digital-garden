I was curious as to whether this setup would allow me to publish pages right from my phone. I assumed that I'd have to clone my repo from github and sync it to my phone, but it turns out as long as I set up the digital garden plugin with my api key from my github account I can still publish new pages from any device and vercel will take care of the rest.

I published a test page from my phone using the obsidian app and it shows up in `src/site/notes`

But I reckon if I want to edit those other pages I'd have to clone them (or download directly).
