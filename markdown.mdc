# Markdown Rules for Digital Garden

## Image Links
```markdown
# ✅ Correct Image Format
![alt text](/img/user/raw_notes/Images/image-name.png)

# ❌ Wrong Formats
![alt text](img\user\raw_notes\Images\image-name.png)    # No backslashes
![alt text](img/user/raw_notes/Images/image-name.png)    # Missing leading slash
![[image-name.png]]                                      # No wiki-style for images
```

## Important Image Rules
- Always use forward slashes (`/`)
- Always start paths with `/` (absolute paths)
- Use standard markdown `![alt](url)` format for images
- URL encode spaces with `%20`
- Images go in `/img/user/raw_notes/Images/`
- Don't use wiki-style links for images

## Note Links and Transclusions
```markdown
# ✅ Correct Internal Link Format
[[Daily Notes/2025-03-21|Title]]     # Internal navigation
[[About|About Page]]                  # Link to note

# ✅ Correct Transclusion Format
![[Daily Notes/2025-03-21]]          # Full note transclusion
![[Daily Notes/2025-03-21#Section]]  # Section transclusion

# ❌ Wrong Formats
[[src/site/notes/About|About]]       # Don't include src/site/notes
![[notes/About.md]]                  # Don't include .md extension
{{Daily Notes/2025-03-21}}          # Don't use curly braces
```

## Important Note Rules
- Don't include `src/site/notes/` in internal links
- Keep the folder structure in links (e.g., `Daily Notes/note-name`)
- Use wiki-style `[[]]` for note links and transclusions
- Remove file extensions (`.md`) from note links
- Use `#` for section transclusions
- Don't use curly braces `{{}}` for transclusions

## Frontmatter Requirements
```yaml
---
{
  "dg-publish": true,
  "dg-path": "path/to/note",
  "permalink": "/path/to/note/"
}
---
```

## Common Patterns
- Images: Standard markdown with absolute paths
- Notes: Wiki-style links with relative paths
- Transclusions: Wiki-style with optional section headers
- Always preview in Obsidian before publishing

## Troubleshooting
1. If images don't show:
   - Check for leading slash
   - Use forward slashes
   - URL encode spaces with `%20`
   - Use standard markdown format

2. If transclusions don't work:
   - Remove `src/site/notes/` from path
   - Use wiki-style `![[]]` syntax
   - Remove `.md` extension
   - Check that target note exists
   - Verify folder structure matches exactly

3. If links don't work:
   - Use wiki-style `[[]]` syntax
   - Keep folder structure
   - Remove `src/site/notes/`
   - Check case sensitivity
